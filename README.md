When the player begins the game, they are given a random name. Throughout the game, the player controls a character with this name. The player's character also has a list of stats that change throughout the course of the game.

The player encounters endless enemies whose names are chosen from a list. These enemies have two stats: "Hp" and "Dmg", which represent the enemy's health and attack power. The player and their enemy take turns attempting to deal damage to each other. If the player loses all of their Hp, they die and the story ends. If the enemy loses all of their Hp, the player gains experience points and moves on to fight an enemy with more health and attack power. When the player gains enough experience points, they level up and get to choose between increasing one of two stats: their attack power or their health points.

After the player defeats their second enemy, they are given a second weapon. From then on, there is a 50/50 chance that a new weapon will be found each time an enemy is defeated. The player can only hold two weapons, so they must choose which weapon they would like to replace. After a weapon is used too many times, it becomes 'Broken', which means that the weapon has a chance to deal no damage.
